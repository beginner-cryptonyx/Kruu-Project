    <div class="main">WHO WE ARE - Team Vaccine Jet has been around for 4 years now, and we have continued to develop and expand our centres and accessibility to our customers. An amazing number of staff look after the management of our websites and social media. When the pandemic COVID -19 began, we realised the importance of vaccines. So we started with the vaccines available in the market at that time, for our neighbourhood. As our business grew, we decided to also give out vaccines for COVID -19.</div>
