        <h1>Influenza</h1>
        <p><b>Age-group:</b> All adults</p>
        <p><b>Dosage:</b> 1 vaccine every year.</p>
        <p><b>Method of injecting:</b> The vaccine is injected via needles or jet injectors in the arm or using nasal sprays.</p>
        <p><b>General Information:</b> This vaccine combats influenza, a viral infection, known commonly as the flu. Common symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and fatigue. It is recommended for even healthy adults to take the vaccine once a year, as this disease is caused by a virus which evolves easily and rapidly, requiring new vaccines, every year.</p>
        <p><b>Who should take the vaccine:</b> It is especially important for individuals with HIV, chronic diseases (such as diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, lung disease, renal disease) or are immunocompromised to take this vaccine. Pregnant women, healthcare workers and individuals above 65 years of age must also take this vaccine.</p>
        <p><b>Who should not take the vaccine:</b> Exceptions to adults who should take the vaccine include, individuals who develop anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to the ingredients of the flu vaccine (such as egg) or individuals who have GBS (Guillain Barré Syndrome). It is also not recommended to take the vaccine when you are ill.</p>
        <p><b>Side-effects:</b> Though the vaccine is safe and you cannot get the flu from the vaccines, there are some side-effects you can experience after the shot including soreness, redness, swelling from the shot, headache, low-grade fever, nausea, prolonged  and muscle aches. If you do experience extremely abnormal symptoms such as high fever, behaviour changes, or signs of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction), admit the individual to the nearest hospital.</p>
        <p><b>Always consult a doctor regarding whether you are eligible for taking the vaccine, and to help decide which vaccine is best for you.</b></p>

      <div id="covid" class="hidden">
        <h1>Covid 19</h1>
        <p><b>Age-group:</b> All Adults</p>
	<p><b>Dosage:</b> Two shots are given three to six months apart, followed by a booster dose every year for those at risk (those with a skin index of 75 or higher, discoloration of fingers or toes, or red or irritated eyes).</p>
	<p><b>Method of injection:</b> The vaccine should be injected via an intramuscular route into either the deltoid region of the upper arm, or the higher anterolateral area of the thigh can also be considered.</p>
	<p><b>General Information:</b> Because the COVID-19 vaccine is still in development, all of its side effects are unknown, and research is ongoing. Since there are several different types of vaccines, each said to have different effects, it seems valuable to consider which suits you the best. The first type would be mRNA, a vaccine that is widely used. It involves inserting a piece of modified RNA, which tells the cell to produce the proteins of the coronavirus and keep them on display so that the body makes antibodies to match them, which will combat the actual vaccines if the individual is ever infected. The RNA breaks down after giving the cells instructions and is hence considered harmless, but some research suggests increased strokes after taking the vaccine. Another type of vaccine is the viral vector vaccine, where the genetic material of the covid-19 virus is placed inside a different modified virus and inserted into the body. Once again, using the DNA inserted, the cells make proteins, for which the immune system reacts by producing antibodies that will combat the virus if it were to enter the body. It is said to be safe, and the vaccine does not cause you to get the actual virus, nor does the DNA of the virus become part of you, but to date this vaccine type has not been recommended for individuals below the age of 18. The third method is using inactivated viruses to make the vaccine. Here, the vaccine is killed using chemicals, heat, or radiation and is then inserted into the body, to which the immune system can react to and remember, without the harmful effects of the real virus. This method is still being developed and is under research, hence no side-effects are known. The final type of vaccines is the live-attenuated vaccine, where a weaker version of the vaccine is inserted into the human body, to which the immune system responds. But this method is not recommended for immunocompromised individuals, due to inserting a live virus into the body.</p>
	<p><b>Who should get the vaccine:</b> All adults, especially those with chronic diseases, HIV, mental health conditions, are obese, or are immunocompromised, are advised to get the vaccine because they are more likely to become seriously ill if they contract COVID-19. Women who are pregnant, also must take the vaccine as it can help protect the newborn baby as well as the mother.</p>
	<p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> It is recommended that individuals above 75 not take the vaccine, especially if they have comorbidities. Those who develop anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to one of the ingredients of the Covid-19 vaccine, must also not take it.</p>
	<p><b>Side-effects:</b> You are likely to have some if not all of these side-effects including pain, redness and swelling on the arm where you got the shot. You can also have other common symptoms of sickness including, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, nausea and joint pain. But there are chances of an individual developing anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction), in which case, admit him/her to the nearest hospital.</p>
	<p><b>Always consult a doctor to determine whether you are eligible for the vaccine and which vaccine is best for you.</b></p>
      </div>
      <div id="HPV" class="hidden">
        <h1>HPV</h1>
        <p><b>Age-group:</b> This vaccine is generally taken at the age of 11 to 12, but if not, it can be taken until 26. Beyond 26, it is not advised to take it without a doctor’s recommendation, as often by this age, almost everyone has already been infected with this disease.</p>
	<p><b>Dosage:</b> Three doses are given for adults, with the second dose given after 1 to 2 months of the first dose and the third dose after 6 months of the second dose.</p>
	<p><b>Method of injecting:</b>  The vaccine should be injected via an intramuscular route into either the deltoid region of the upper arm, or the higher anterolateral area of the thigh can also be considered.</p>
	<p><b>General Information:</b>HPV or the Human Papillomavirus isa disease transmitted sexually from an infected person that can cause cervical, anal and other cancers if present in the body for long periods. HPV comes in two forms, low-risk and high risk. Symptoms of low-risk HPV can include skin warts on the hands, feet and skin around the genitals and the anus. Sometimes they can cause warts in the inside of the larynx causing breathing issues, but they do not cause cancer and often go on their own without treatment. High-risk HPV on the other hand often shows no symptoms, while on the inside, over prolonged periods in the body cause changes to the cell resulting in several forms of cancer. Symptoms of this form of cancer are itching, bleeding, pain or swollen glands, making it important to go through regular screening. Instead, taking the vaccine is very efficient at preventing all of this.</p>
	<p><b>Who should take the vaccine?:</b> Men and women who haven’t taken the vaccine at younger ages must take the vaccine, especially if they are sexually active. It is also recommended for individuals who have HIV, liver disease, renal disease or are immunocompromised to prevent risks of the infection.</p>
	<p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> Individuals who develop anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to the ingredients of the HPV vaccine, or those who are allergic to yeast are not recommended to take the vaccine. Women who are pregnant must also not take this vaccine.</p>
	<p><b>Side-effects:</b> Several people face no side-effects after the vaccine, but those who do often face mild side-effects such as pain, redness, or swelling in the arm where the shot was given, fever, headache, fatigue, nausea and muscle or joint pain. But there are chances of an individual developing anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction), in which case, admit him/her to the nearest hospital.</p>
	<p><b>Always consult a doctor regarding whether you are eligible for taking the vaccine, and to help decide which vaccine is best for you.</b></p>

      <div id="Tdap" class="hidden">
        <h1>Tdap</h1>
        <p><b>Age-group:</b> All adults</p>
<p><b>Dosage:</b> It needs to be taken once during adulthood if not taken during adolescence and following that, every 10 years, a Tdap booster shot or Td (Tetanus, Diphtheria) should be taken. Pregnant women should also get the vaccine during every pregnancy.</p>
<p><b>Method of injecting:</b> The vaccine is injected into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.</p>
<p><b>General Information:</b> Tetanus is a bacterial infection that enters the body through cuts in the skin, usually made by the contaminated substance. It affects the nervous system, causing the neck and mouth muscles to become painfully rigid, preventing swallowing and breathing, often leading to death. Diphtheria is a bacterial infection that can lead to the inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose and throat and, in severe cases, damage the heart, kidney, and nervous system. Spreading rapidly from person to person through respiratory droplets, it can cause difficulty breathing, heart failure, paralysis, or even death. The third is a respiratory disease called pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough. When the infected individual coughs or sneezes, small water droplets containing the bacterium are released, which can infect other people, causing swelling of the airways and violent coughing that makes it hard to breathe, eat, or drink. It can also cause weight loss, loss of bladder control, passing out, and rib fractures. </p>
<p><b>Who should take the vaccine:</b> All adults are advised to take the Tdap vaccine, but especially individuals with chronic diseases, HIV, or who are immunocompromised. Healthcare workers, caregivers of infants, and individuals who travel to regions where pertussis is common are all advised to take Tdap as well. Pregnant women must also take the vaccine during pregnancy (even if taken before the pregnancy) to help protect the baby in the first few months after its birth.</p>
<p><b>Who should not take the vaccine:</b> If you have previously had a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to the ingredients in the vaccine, it is advised that you don’t take the vaccine. Those with epilepsy or GBS (Guillain-Barre Syndrome) must consult with their doctor before taking the vaccine. It is also recommended to take the vaccine when you are not sick.</p>
<p><b>Side-effects:</b> Like any vaccine, there are some mild side-effects after the vaccines that are rarely life-threatening. This can include pain, redness, or swelling in the arm where the shot was given; a mild fever; a headache; tiredness; stomach upset; muscle aches and pains; or swollen glands. Though it is rare, there are chances of an individual developing anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction), usually a few minutes after the shot. In which case, take the person to the nearest hospital.</p>

      <div id="Varicella" class="hidden">
        <h1>Varicella</h1>
        <p><b>Age-group:</b> All adults who have never gotten the vaccine or disease previously.</p>
	<p><b>Dosage:</b> Two doses must be taken between 4 to 8 weeks apart for adults.</p>
	<p><b>Method of injecting:</b> The vaccine should be injected via an intramuscular route into either the deltoid region of the upper arm, or the higher anterolateral area of the thigh can also be considered.</p>
	<p><b>General Information:</b> The varicella vaccine helps combat against a contagious disease called chicken pox. This disease is caused by the varicella-zoster virus and can cause rashes to appear all over the body starting with the chest, back, and face, and then spreads over the entire body. The main vaccine against chickenpox is Varivax and is agreed for use for people above 1 year old.</p>
	<p><b>Who should take the vaccine?:</b> All adults are recommended to take this vaccine, if they have never been exposed to it before. This is especially true for healthcare professionals (those around patients), childcare workers (those around children, including family members), college students, military personnel, non-pregnant women of child-bearing age and international travellers. Individuals who have renal disease or liver disease are also recommended to take this vaccine.</p>
	<p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> Those who have previously gotten chicken pox, do not have to take the vaccine. Women who are pregnant, individuals who have tuberculosis, individuals who develop anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to an ingredient of the vaccine or have recently gotten a blood transfusion must not take the vaccine. If certain individuals are being treated for cancer or with drugs that affect the immune system, they are also advised not to take the vaccine. For people who have HIV/AIDS (or any disease that can affect the immune system), any kind of cancer, are immunocompromised or are on steroids, it is advised for them to consult a doctor, who can (based on the individual’s health condition) decide whether it is recommended for them to take the vaccine.</p>
	<p><b>Side-effects:</b> As with any vaccine, there are some side-effects of the varicella vaccine, this can include a sore arm from the injection, redness or rash where the shot is given or fever. More serious but rare side-effects can include pneumonia, infection of the brain and/or spinal cord covering, seizures, anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to an ingredient of the vaccine or the development of shingles years after being vaccinated (but the development of shingles is much more likely with those who get infected with the virus instead of being vaccinated).</p>

      <div id="Zoster" class="hidden">
        <h1>Zoster</h1>
        <p><b>Age-group:</b> Adults who are 50 years and older</p>
	<p><b>Dosage:</b> Single dose of Zostavax for people 60 years old and older. Adults 50 years and older should get two doses of Shingrix, separated by 2 to 6 months. Adults 19 years and older who have or will have weakened immune systems because of disease or therapy should also get two doses of Shingrix.</p>
	<p><b>Method of injecting:</b>  The vaccine should be injected via an intramuscular route into the deltoid region of the upper arm.</p>
	<p><b>General Information:</b> Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, otherwise known as the virus that causes chicken pox. Symptoms of shingles include fever, headache, child, upset stomach and of course rashes and blisters filled with clear fluid (usually on one side of the body, especially on the head, neck, or torso). The blisters typically start healing within 7 to 10 days and go away within a month. Yet the infection can cause nerve pain or PHN (postherpetic neuralgia). The two main vaccines currently in use are Zostavax (a live virus vaccine) and Shingrix (currently preferred more than Zostavax). There is no need to check if an individual has had chickenpox previously to get the vaccine, but vaccinating at a young age may not be as useful as at an older age as vaccine efficacy is said to wane after 5 years.</p>
	<p><b>Who should take the vaccine?:</b> It is recommended that any individual above 50 to take this vaccine, especially for those who have diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, lung disease or renal disease.</p>
	<p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> Zostavax should not be administered to an individual who has developed anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of shingles vaccine. Individuals who are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed, because of drugs or diseases that affect the immune system, such as those who have HIV/AIDS or are on steroids. Individuals who have cancers affecting bone marrow or the lymphatic system (for example, leukaemia or lymphoma) or are going through cancer treatment (for example radiation or chemotherapy) should also not get the vaccine. Women must not get the vaccine when they are pregnant and must not get pregnant until 4 weeks after the vaccine is taken.</p>
	<p><b>Side-effects:</b> Though, most people don’t develop side effects from the shingles vaccine, for some pain and soreness in the arm where the injection was administered is possible. The FDA also has issued a warning in 2021, and though the connection is unclear and more research must be done before confirming, there are chances of the vaccine causing Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a rare condition where the body’s immune system acts on certain regions of the nervous system. In some other severe cases, a person develops anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction).</p>

      <div id="Yellow Fever" class="hidden">
        <h1>Yellow Fever</h1>
        <p><b>Age-group:</b> Adults up to 59 years old</p>
        <p><b>Dosage:</b> One dose in a lifetime</p>
        <p><b>Method of injecting:</b> Yellow fever vaccine should be injected into the arm that was NOT used for measles immunisation (if the measles vaccine has  been taken)</p>
        <p><b>General Information:</b> Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes. The virus takes 3 to 6 days to incubate and can result in jaundice of yellow colour in some patients, hence the name yellow fever. Though many people are asymptomatic, those who do show symptoms commonly have fever, muscle pain, prominent backache, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. For most, the symptoms disappear in 3 to 4 days, but for some, they enter a toxic phase, where high fever and several body systems are affected. Within 7 to 10 days of infection, half of the patients in this phase die. The vaccine is safe, effective and affordable and can help avoid this. It must be taken especially if  visiting tropical areas of Africa and Central and South America, where the virus is endemic.</p>
        <p><b>Who should take the vaccine?:</b> Individuals who are travelling to or are living in areas at risk for yellow fever virus, such as in Africa and South America must take the vaccine. Laboratory personnel working on the virus must also take the vaccine.</p>
        <p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> The vaccine is not recommended for individuals who develop anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to the components of the vaccine (like eggs), have had organ transplants, are diagnosed with a malignant tumour or are immunosuppressed/ immunocompromised. Individuals who have diseases or disorders relating to the immune system must also not take the vaccine including individuals who have a HIV infection, CD4+ T-lymphocytes, primary immunodeficiency or thymus disorder associated with abnormal immune function.</p>
        <p><b>Side-effects:</b> Side-effects to this vaccine are generally mild, and can include headaches, low-grade fevers or muscle aches. At times, severe reactions to the vaccine may develop, including anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction), dysfunction of the internal organs, swelling of the brain, spinal cord or surrounding tissues (encephalitis or meningitis) or GBS (Guillain Barré Syndrome).</p>

      <div id="Cholera" class="hidden">
        <h1>Cholera</h1>
        <p><b>Age-group:</b> Adults beneath the age of 64</p>
	<p><b>Dosage:</b> One or two doses depending on your doctor.</p>
	<p><b>Method of injecting:</b> The vaccine is injected orally (swallowed).</p>
	<p><b>General Information:</b> The cholera vaccine combats against a bacterial infection called cholera. The disease spreads from the contaminated faeces of an infected individual and even through contaminated food and water. Keeping a track on what you eat and drink while you are travelling is always a good practice to stop the spread of diseases like cholera. Common symptoms of this disease include watery diarrhoea, dehydration, thirst, nausea and vomiting. About 10% of individuals that get infected develop severe symptoms such as leg cramps, electrolyte imbalance or shock. To avoid this, the cholera vaccine can be administered, but care must be taken as the vaccine is a live, attenuated (weakened) vaccine, which can be shed in stool (transmitted via faeces) for at least 7 days. There are 3 cholera vaccines that are certified by the WHO; the Dukoral vaccine, the Shanchol vaccine and the Euvichol vaccine. The Dukoral vaccine requires two doses with a gap ranging from 7 days to 6 weeks and the protection lasts for 2 years. On the other hand, the Shanchol vaccine and the Euvichol vaccine require two doses with a gap ranging of atleast 2 weeks and the protection lasts for 3 years.</p>
	<p><b>Who should take the vaccine?:</b> It is recommended for people to take the vaccine if they live or are travelling to regions where local transmission of cholera occurs, where cholera outbreaks are taking place or where a humanitarian crisis has taken place (such as an earthquake, where people have to live in close quarters with poor sanitation, so a higher risk of cholera). Regions where cholera is popular currently include parts of Africa, Haiti and parts of Southeastern Asia.</p>
	<p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> It is recommended that individuals who develop anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to any of the components  of the cholera vaccine to not take the vaccine. It is also not advised for individuals who are immunocompromised, immunosuppressed (such as when on antibiotics or anti-malaria drugs) or pregnant to take the vaccine. People around the above individuals must also not take the vaccine, to reduce the chances of transmission.</p>
	<p><b>Side-effects:</b> As the vaccine is made from a live, attenuated (weakened) version of the vaccine, there are chances of some side-effects. These can include tiredness, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lack of appetite, and diarrhoea. As with any vaccine, there is also the chance of an individual developing anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction), in which case, admit him/her to the nearest hospital.</p>

      <div id="Hepatitis_A" class="hidden">
        <h1>Hepatitis A</h1>
	<p><b>Age-group:</b> All adults</p>
	<p><b>Dosage:</b> 2 doses with a gap of at least 6 months</p>
	<p><b>Method of injecting:</b>  The vaccine should be injected via an intramuscular route into the deltoid region of the upper arm.</p>
	<p><b>General Information:</b> Hepatitis A is a highly contagious , short-term liver infection caused by a virus. It can spread from the stool or blood of an infected person or from contaminated food or water. Unlike Hepatitis B and C, Hepatitis A does not often result in chronic diseases. An infected person can display symptoms, but usually they show up after being infected for 2 to 7 weeks. These symptoms can include, yellow skin or eyes, loss of appetite, upset stomach, vomiting, stomach pain, fever, diarrhoea, joint pain, fatigue, dark urine or light-coloured stools (poop). Symptoms usually go away within 2 months, but for some people, they can be ill for 6 months. Maintaining good hygiene is vital to avoiding Hepatitis A. Remember to be careful of what you eat or drink, wash your hands after using the bathroom. But the best way to prevent the disease is taking the vaccine. It is especially important for those travelling abroad where Hepatitis A is endemic, such as most of Africa, Central America, South America and Asia. </p>
	<p><b>Who should take the vaccine?:</b> It is recommended for individuals who have HIV, chronic liver disease, an occupational risk (such as international travellers and healthcare workers), are homeless, use injection or non-injection drugs or are at chances of being/have been in close contact with an individual from an international country/an individual infected from Hepatitis A to take the vaccine. Pregnant women at risk of Hepatitis A must also take the vaccine.</p>
	<p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> Individuals who develop  anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to any of the components of the vaccine (such as the antibiotic Neomycin or yeast) must not take the vaccine.</p>
	<p><b>Side-effects:</b> Just like with any vaccine, there are chances of developing side-effects to this vaccine. This can include swelling, tenderness, redness, warmth, or a hard lump where the shot was given, a low fever, a common sickly feeling, nausea, loss of appetite or headache.</p>
	<p><b>Always consult a doctor regarding whether you are eligible for taking the vaccine, and to help decide which vaccine is best for you.</b></p>

      <div id="Hepatitis_B" class="hidden">
        <h1>Hepatitis B</h1>
	<p><b>Age-group:</b> All adults</p>
	<p><b>Dosage:</b> The number of doses often depends on the vaccine. For some vaccines two doses must be taken, 1 month apart, whereas for others, three doses must be taken, the first and second dose 1 month apart and the third dose taken 5 months after the second dose.</p>
	<p><b>Method of injecting:</b> The vaccine should be injected via an intramuscular route into the deltoid region of the upper arm.</p>
	<p><b>General Information:</b> Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is spread when infected blood, semen, or other body fluids enters the body of a person who is not infected. It is transmitted through blood or other bodily fluids, from mother to baby, or using injections, tattooing or piercing. This deadly disease can survive outside the body for atleast 7 days and has an incubation period of minimum 30 days.  As a short-term illness, symptoms of Hepatitis B can include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay-coloured bowel movements, joint pain, jaundice (yellow colour in the skin or the eyes). But as long-term, chronic infection (after 6 months of infection), the disease does not show symptoms for even decades, and can result in liver damage, cirrhosis, liver cancer and death. </p>
	<p><b>Who should take the vaccine?:</b> Individuals who have HIV, diabetes, liver disease, renal disease, are active sexually, inject drugs or live with someone who has Hepatitis B. Health care professionals and public safety workers should also get the vaccine.</p>
	<p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> Individuals who develop  anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to any of the components of the vaccine (such as the antibiotic Neomycin or yeast) must not take the vaccine.</p>
	<p><b>Side-effects:</b> Side-effects of the Hepatitis B vaccine can include soreness, redness, or swelling in the arm where the shot was given, headache or fever.</p>

      <div id="Typhoid" class="hidden">
        <h1>Typhoid</h1>
        <p><b>Age-group:</b> All Adults</p>
	<p><b>Dosage:</b> For the inactivated typhoid vaccine, one dose is recommended atleast 2 weeks before travel and repeated doses every 2 years, for continued protection. The live typhoid vaccine on the other hand requires 4 capsules to be taken on alternate days with the last capsule taken atleast one week before travel. A booster vaccine for this is required every 5 years.</p>
	<p><b>Method of injecting:</b> The inactivated typhoid vaccine is administered as an injection into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. On the contrary, the live typhoid vaccine is administered orally and must be swallowed before meals with cold or lukewarm water.</p>
	<p><b>General Information:</b> Typhoid fever, otherwise known as enteric fever, is caused by the salmonella bacteria. This disease spreads through contaminated food and water, or person-to-person contact. The vaccines do not provide complete protection from all the strains of the salmonella bacteria, hence it is always recommended to maintain good hygiene especially when travelling to areas such as South Asia and Africa, where typhoid is common. Treating water and sewage to kill germs and human waste disposal is vital to halt the spread of the vaccine. Common symptoms of typhoid fever can include weakness, stomach pain, headache, diarrhoea, constipation, cough or loss of appetite. There are two types of vaccines to combat this disease, inactivated typhoid vaccines and live typhoid vaccines. Inactivated typhoid vaccines are composed of dead, or inactivated salmonella bacteria, where the bacteria cannot affect the body cells but still activates an immune response. It is administered as an injection with one dose recommended atleast 2 weeks before travel and repeated doses every 2 years, for continued protection. The live typhoid vaccine on the contrary, contains live attenuated bacteria which are still capable of replicating within the host. But, the bacteria are ‘weakened’, meaning that they have lost most of their pathogenic characteristics. This vaccine is administered orally and must be swallowed before meals with cold or lukewarm water. It requires 4 capsules to be taken on alternate days with the last capsule taken atleast one week before travel. A booster vaccine for this is required every 5 years.</p>
	<p><b>Who should take the vaccine?:</b> Though everyone does not have to take this vaccine, it is recommended that people in close contact with a typhoid carrier, individuals working with the salmonella bacteria in the lab or travellers who are going to areas where typhoid is common (such as South Asia and Africa), are recommended to take this vaccine.</p>
	<p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> It is recommended that those who develop  anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to any of the components  of the vaccine, is immunocompromised, is immunosuppressed, is taking antibiotics or is taking anti-malarial drugs. Pregnant and breastfeeding women must not take the vaccine as well.</p>
	<p><b>Side-effects:</b> Side-effects, in this case, depend on which vaccine you take. Common side-effects for those who take the inactivated typhoid vaccine are pain, redness, or swelling at the site of the injection, fever, headache, and general discomfort can happen after inactivated typhoid vaccine. On the other hand side-effects of the live typhoid vaccine not include fever or headache, but also abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting.</p>

        <p><b>Age-group:</b> All adults</p>
        <p><b>Dosage:</b> 1 vaccine every year.</p>
        <p><b>Method of injecting:</b> The vaccine is injected via needles or jet injectors in the arm or using nasal sprays.</p>
        <p><b>General Information:</b> This vaccine combats influenza, a viral infection, known commonly as the flu. Common symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and fatigue. It is recommended for even healthy adults to take the vaccine once a year, as this disease is caused by a virus which evolves easily and rapidly, requiring new vaccines, every year.</p>
        <p><b>Who should take the vaccine:</b> It is especially important for individuals with HIV, chronic diseases (such as diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, lung disease, renal disease) or are immunocompromised to take this vaccine. Pregnant women, healthcare workers and individuals above 65 years of age must also take this vaccine.</p>
        <p><b>Who should not take the vaccine:</b> Exceptions to adults who should take the vaccine include, individuals who develop anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to the ingredients of the flu vaccine (such as egg) or individuals who have GBS (Guillain Barré Syndrome). It is also not recommended to take the vaccine when you are ill.</p>
        <p><b>Side-effects:</b> Though the vaccine is safe and you cannot get the flu from the vaccines, there are some side-effects you can experience after the shot including soreness, redness, swelling from the shot, headache, low-grade fever, nausea, prolonged  and muscle aches. If you do experience extremely abnormal symptoms such as high fever, behaviour changes, or signs of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction), admit the individual to the nearest hospital.</p>

        <h1>Covid 19</h1>
        <p><b>Age-group:</b> All Adults</p>
	<p><b>Dosage:</b> Two shots are given three to six months apart, followed by a booster dose every year for those at risk (those with a skin index of 75 or higher, discoloration of fingers or toes, or red or irritated eyes).</p>
	<p><b>Method of injection:</b> The vaccine should be injected via an intramuscular route into either the deltoid region of the upper arm, or the higher anterolateral area of the thigh can also be considered.</p>
	<p><b>General Information:</b> Because the COVID-19 vaccine is still in development, all of its side effects are unknown, and research is ongoing. Since there are several different types of vaccines, each said to have different effects, it seems valuable to consider which suits you the best. The first type would be mRNA, a vaccine that is widely used. It involves inserting a piece of modified RNA, which tells the cell to produce the proteins of the coronavirus and keep them on display so that the body makes antibodies to match them, which will combat the actual vaccines if the individual is ever infected. The RNA breaks down after giving the cells instructions and is hence considered harmless, but some research suggests increased strokes after taking the vaccine. Another type of vaccine is the viral vector vaccine, where the genetic material of the covid-19 virus is placed inside a different modified virus and inserted into the body. Once again, using the DNA inserted, the cells make proteins, for which the immune system reacts by producing antibodies that will combat the virus if it were to enter the body. It is said to be safe, and the vaccine does not cause you to get the actual virus, nor does the DNA of the virus become part of you, but to date this vaccine type has not been recommended for individuals below the age of 18. The third method is using inactivated viruses to make the vaccine. Here, the vaccine is killed using chemicals, heat, or radiation and is then inserted into the body, to which the immune system can react to and remember, without the harmful effects of the real virus. This method is still being developed and is under research, hence no side-effects are known. The final type of vaccines is the live-attenuated vaccine, where a weaker version of the vaccine is inserted into the human body, to which the immune system responds. But this method is not recommended for immunocompromised individuals, due to inserting a live virus into the body.</p>
	<p><b>Who should get the vaccine:</b> All adults, especially those with chronic diseases, HIV, mental health conditions, are obese, or are immunocompromised, are advised to get the vaccine because they are more likely to become seriously ill if they contract COVID-19. Women who are pregnant, also must take the vaccine as it can help protect the newborn baby as well as the mother.</p>
	<p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> It is recommended that individuals above 75 not take the vaccine, especially if they have comorbidities. Those who develop anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to one of the ingredients of the Covid-19 vaccine, must also not take it.</p>
	<p><b>Side-effects:</b> You are likely to have some if not all of these side-effects including pain, redness and swelling on the arm where you got the shot. You can also have other common symptoms of sickness including, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, nausea and joint pain. But there are chances of an individual developing anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction), in which case, admit him/her to the nearest hospital.</p>

        <h1>HPV</h1>
        <p><b>Age-group:</b> This vaccine is generally taken at the age of 11 to 12, but if not, it can be taken until 26. Beyond 26, it is not advised to take it without a doctor’s recommendation, as often by this age, almost everyone has already been infected with this disease.</p>
        <p><b>Dosage:</b> Three doses are given for adults, with the second dose given after 1 to 2 months of the first dose and the third dose after 6 months of the second dose.</p>
        <p><b>Method of injecting:</b>  The vaccine should be injected via an intramuscular route into either the deltoid region of the upper arm, or the higher anterolateral area of the thigh can also be considered.</p>
        <p><b>General Information:</b>HPV or the Human Papillomavirus isa disease transmitted sexually from an infected person that can cause cervical, anal and other cancers if present in the body for long periods. HPV comes in two forms, low-risk and high risk. Symptoms of low-risk HPV can include skin warts on the hands, feet and skin around the genitals and the anus. Sometimes they can cause warts in the inside of the larynx causing breathing issues, but they do not cause cancer and often go on their own without treatment. High-risk HPV on the other hand often shows no symptoms, while on the inside, over prolonged periods in the body cause changes to the cell resulting in several forms of cancer. Symptoms of this form of cancer are itching, bleeding, pain or swollen glands, making it important to go through regular screening. Instead, taking the vaccine is very efficient at preventing all of this.</p>
        <p><b>Who should take the vaccine?:</b> Men and women who haven’t taken the vaccine at younger ages must take the vaccine, especially if they are sexually active. It is also recommended for individuals who have HIV, liver disease, renal disease or are immunocompromised to prevent risks of the infection.</p>
        <p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> Individuals who develop anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to the ingredients of the HPV vaccine, or those who are allergic to yeast are not recommended to take the vaccine. Women who are pregnant must also not take this vaccine.</p>
        <p><b>Side-effects:</b> Several people face no side-effects after the vaccine, but those who do often face mild side-effects such as pain, redness, or swelling in the arm where the shot was given, fever, headache, fatigue, nausea and muscle or joint pain. But there are chances of an individual developing anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction), in which case, admit him/her to the nearest hospital.</p>

        <p><b>Method of injecting:</b> The vaccine should be injected via an intramuscular route into either the deltoid region of the upper arm, or the higher anterolateral area of the thigh can also be considered.</p>
        <p><b>General Information:</b> The varicella vaccine helps combat against a contagious disease called chicken pox. This disease is caused by the varicella-zoster virus and can cause rashes to appear all over the body starting with the chest, back, and face, and then spreads over the entire body. The main vaccine against chickenpox is Varivax and is agreed for use for people above 1 year old.</p>
        <p><b>Who should take the vaccine?:</b> All adults are recommended to take this vaccine, if they have never been exposed to it before. This is especially true for healthcare professionals (those around patients), childcare workers (those around children, including family members), college students, military personnel, non-pregnant women of child-bearing age and international travellers. Individuals who have renal disease or liver disease are also recommended to take this vaccine.</p>
        <p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> Those who have previously gotten chicken pox, do not have to take the vaccine. Women who are pregnant, individuals who have tuberculosis, individuals who develop anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to an ingredient of the vaccine or have recently gotten a blood transfusion must not take the vaccine. If certain individuals are being treated for cancer or with drugs that affect the immune system, they are also advised not to take the vaccine. For people who have HIV/AIDS (or any disease that can affect the immune system), any kind of cancer, are immunocompromised or are on steroids, it is advised for them to consult a doctor, who can (based on the individual’s health condition) decide whether it is recommended for them to take the vaccine.</p>
        <p><b>Side-effects:</b> As with any vaccine, there are some side-effects of the varicella vaccine, this can include a sore arm from the injection, redness or rash where the shot is given or fever. More serious but rare side-effects can include pneumonia, infection of the brain and/or spinal cord covering, seizures, anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to an ingredient of the vaccine or the development of shingles years after being vaccinated (but the development of shingles is much more likely with those who get infected with the virus instead of being vaccinated).</p>
        <p><b>Always consult a doctor regarding whether you are eligible for taking the vaccine, and to help decide which vaccine is best for you.</b></p>

      <button class="collapsable">Zoster</button>
      <div class="content" >
        <h1>Zoster</h1>
        <p><b>Age-group:</b> Adults who are 50 years and older</p>
        <p><b>Dosage:</b> Single dose of Zostavax for people 60 years old and older. Adults 50 years and older should get two doses of Shingrix, separated by 2 to 6 months. Adults 19 years and older who have or will have weakened immune systems because of disease or therapy should also get two doses of Shingrix.</p>
        <p><b>Method of injecting:</b>  The vaccine should be injected via an intramuscular route into the deltoid region of the upper arm.</p>
        <p><b>General Information:</b> Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, otherwise known as the virus that causes chicken pox. Symptoms of shingles include fever, headache, child, upset stomach and of course rashes and blisters filled with clear fluid (usually on one side of the body, especially on the head, neck, or torso). The blisters typically start healing within 7 to 10 days and go away within a month. Yet the infection can cause nerve pain or PHN (postherpetic neuralgia). The two main vaccines currently in use are Zostavax (a live virus vaccine) and Shingrix (currently preferred more than Zostavax). There is no need to check if an individual has had chickenpox previously to get the vaccine, but vaccinating at a young age may not be as useful as at an older age as vaccine efficacy is said to wane after 5 years.</p>
        <p><b>Who should take the vaccine?:</b> It is recommended that any individual above 50 to take this vaccine, especially for those who have diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, lung disease or renal disease.</p>
        <p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> Zostavax should not be administered to an individual who has developed anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of shingles vaccine. Individuals who are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed, because of drugs or diseases that affect the immune system, such as those who have HIV/AIDS or are on steroids. Individuals who have cancers affecting bone marrow or the lymphatic system (for example, leukaemia or lymphoma) or are going through cancer treatment (for example radiation or chemotherapy) should also not get the vaccine. Women must not get the vaccine when they are pregnant and must not get pregnant until 4 weeks after the vaccine is taken.</p>
        <p><b>Side-effects:</b> Though, most people don’t develop side effects from the shingles vaccine, for some pain and soreness in the arm where the injection was administered is possible. The FDA also has issued a warning in 2021, and though the connection is unclear and more research must be done before confirming, there are chances of the vaccine causing Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a rare condition where the body’s immune system acts on certain regions of the nervous system. In some other severe cases, a person develops anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction).</p>

      <button class="collapsable">Yellow Fever</button>
      <div class="content" >
        <h1>Yellow Fever</h1>
        <p><b>Age-group:</b> Adults up to 59 years old</p>
        <p><b>Dosage:</b> One dose in a lifetime</p>
        <p><b>Method of injecting:</b> Yellow fever vaccine should be injected into the arm that was NOT used for measles immunisation (if the measles vaccine has  been taken)</p>
        <p><b>General Information:</b> Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes. The virus takes 3 to 6 days to incubate and can result in jaundice of yellow colour in some patients, hence the name yellow fever. Though many people are asymptomatic, those who do show symptoms commonly have fever, muscle pain, prominent backache, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. For most, the symptoms disappear in 3 to 4 days, but for some, they enter a toxic phase, where high fever and several body systems are affected. Within 7 to 10 days of infection, half of the patients in this phase die. The vaccine is safe, effective and affordable and can help avoid this. It must be taken especially if  visiting tropical areas of Africa and Central and South America, where the virus is endemic.</p>
        <p><b>Who should take the vaccine?:</b> Individuals who are travelling to or are living in areas at risk for yellow fever virus, such as in Africa and South America must take the vaccine. Laboratory personnel working on the virus must also take the vaccine.</p>
        <p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> The vaccine is not recommended for individuals who develop anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to the components of the vaccine (like eggs), have had organ transplants, are diagnosed with a malignant tumour or are immunosuppressed/ immunocompromised. Individuals who have diseases or disorders relating to the immune system must also not take the vaccine including individuals who have a HIV infection, CD4+ T-lymphocytes, primary immunodeficiency or thymus disorder associated with abnormal immune function.</p>
        <p><b>Side-effects:</b> Side-effects to this vaccine are generally mild, and can include headaches, low-grade fevers or muscle aches. At times, severe reactions to the vaccine may develop, including anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction), dysfunction of the internal organs, swelling of the brain, spinal cord or surrounding tissues (encephalitis or meningitis) or GBS (Guillain Barré Syndrome).</p>

      <button class="collapsable">Cholera</button>
      <div class="content" >
        <h1>Cholera</h1>
        <p><b>Age-group:</b> Adults beneath the age of 64</p>
	<p><b>Dosage:</b> One or two doses depending on your doctor.</p>
	<p><b>Method of injecting:</b> The vaccine is injected orally (swallowed).</p>
	<p><b>General Information:</b> The cholera vaccine combats against a bacterial infection called cholera. The disease spreads from the contaminated faeces of an infected individual and even through contaminated food and water. Keeping a track on what you eat and drink while you are travelling is always a good practice to stop the spread of diseases like cholera. Common symptoms of this disease include watery diarrhoea, dehydration, thirst, nausea and vomiting. About 10% of individuals that get infected develop severe symptoms such as leg cramps, electrolyte imbalance or shock. To avoid this, the cholera vaccine can be administered, but care must be taken as the vaccine is a live, attenuated (weakened) vaccine, which can be shed in stool (transmitted via faeces) for at least 7 days. There are 3 cholera vaccines that are certified by the WHO; the Dukoral vaccine, the Shanchol vaccine and the Euvichol vaccine. The Dukoral vaccine requires two doses with a gap ranging from 7 days to 6 weeks and the protection lasts for 2 years. On the other hand, the Shanchol vaccine and the Euvichol vaccine require two doses with a gap ranging of atleast 2 weeks and the protection lasts for 3 years.</p>
	<p><b>Who should take the vaccine?:</b> It is recommended for people to take the vaccine if they live or are travelling to regions where local transmission of cholera occurs, where cholera outbreaks are taking place or where a humanitarian crisis has taken place (such as an earthquake, where people have to live in close quarters with poor sanitation, so a higher risk of cholera). Regions where cholera is popular currently include parts of Africa, Haiti and parts of Southeastern Asia.</p>
	<p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> It is recommended that individuals who develop anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to any of the components  of the cholera vaccine to not take the vaccine. It is also not advised for individuals who are immunocompromised, immunosuppressed (such as when on antibiotics or anti-malaria drugs) or pregnant to take the vaccine. People around the above individuals must also not take the vaccine, to reduce the chances of transmission.</p>
	<p><b>Side-effects:</b> As the vaccine is made from a live, attenuated (weakened) version of the vaccine, there are chances of some side-effects. These can include tiredness, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lack of appetite, and diarrhoea. As with any vaccine, there is also the chance of an individual developing anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction), in which case, admit him/her to the nearest hospital.</p>
	<p><b>Always consult a doctor regarding whether you are eligible for taking the vaccine, and to help decide which vaccine is best for you.</b></p>

      <button class="collapsable">Hepatitis A</button>
      <div class="content" >
        <h1>Hepatitis A</h1>
	<p><b>Age-group:</b> All adults</p>
	<p><b>Dosage:</b> 2 doses with a gap of at least 6 months</p>
	<p><b>Method of injecting:</b>  The vaccine should be injected via an intramuscular route into the deltoid region of the upper arm.</p>
	<p><b>General Information:</b> Hepatitis A is a highly contagious , short-term liver infection caused by a virus. It can spread from the stool or blood of an infected person or from contaminated food or water. Unlike Hepatitis B and C, Hepatitis A does not often result in chronic diseases. An infected person can display symptoms, but usually they show up after being infected for 2 to 7 weeks. These symptoms can include, yellow skin or eyes, loss of appetite, upset stomach, vomiting, stomach pain, fever, diarrhoea, joint pain, fatigue, dark urine or light-coloured stools (poop). Symptoms usually go away within 2 months, but for some people, they can be ill for 6 months. Maintaining good hygiene is vital to avoiding Hepatitis A. Remember to be careful of what you eat or drink, wash your hands after using the bathroom. But the best way to prevent the disease is taking the vaccine. It is especially important for those travelling abroad where Hepatitis A is endemic, such as most of Africa, Central America, South America and Asia. </p>
	<p><b>Who should take the vaccine?:</b> It is recommended for individuals who have HIV, chronic liver disease, an occupational risk (such as international travellers and healthcare workers), are homeless, use injection or non-injection drugs or are at chances of being/have been in close contact with an individual from an international country/an individual infected from Hepatitis A to take the vaccine. Pregnant women at risk of Hepatitis A must also take the vaccine.</p>
	<p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> Individuals who develop  anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to any of the components of the vaccine (such as the antibiotic Neomycin or yeast) must not take the vaccine.</p>
	<p><b>Side-effects:</b> Just like with any vaccine, there are chances of developing side-effects to this vaccine. This can include swelling, tenderness, redness, warmth, or a hard lump where the shot was given, a low fever, a common sickly feeling, nausea, loss of appetite or headache.</p>
	<p><b>Always consult a doctor regarding whether you are eligible for taking the vaccine, and to help decide which vaccine is best for you.</b></p>

      <button class="collapsable">Hepatitis B</button>
      <div class="content">
        <h1>Hepatitis B</h1>
        <p><b>Age-group:</b> All adults</p>
        <p><b>Dosage:</b> The number of doses often depends on the vaccine. For some vaccines two doses must be taken, 1 month apart, whereas for others, three doses must be taken, the first and second dose 1 month apart and the third dose taken 5 months after the second dose.</p>
        <p><b>Method of injecting:</b> The vaccine should be injected via an intramuscular route into the deltoid region of the upper arm.</p>
        <p><b>General Information:</b> Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is spread when infected blood, semen, or other body fluids enters the body of a person who is not infected. It is transmitted through blood or other bodily fluids, from mother to baby, or using injections, tattooing or piercing. This deadly disease can survive outside the body for atleast 7 days and has an incubation period of minimum 30 days.  As a short-term illness, symptoms of Hepatitis B can include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay-coloured bowel movements, joint pain, jaundice (yellow colour in the skin or the eyes). But as long-term, chronic infection (after 6 months of infection), the disease does not show symptoms for even decades, and can result in liver damage, cirrhosis, liver cancer and death. </p>
        <p><b>Who should take the vaccine?:</b> Individuals who have HIV, diabetes, liver disease, renal disease, are active sexually, inject drugs or live with someone who has Hepatitis B. Health care professionals and public safety workers should also get the vaccine.</p>
        <p><b>Who should not take the vaccine?:</b> Individuals who develop  anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to any of the components of the vaccine (such as the antibiotic Neomycin or yeast) must not take the vaccine.</p>
        <p><b>Side-effects:</b> Side-effects of the Hepatitis B vaccine can include soreness, redness, or swelling in the arm where the shot was given, headache or fever.</p>
