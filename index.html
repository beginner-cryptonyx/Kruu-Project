          Vaccines are an essential part of living a long healthy life for both
          children and adults. They help to protect us from diseases that can be
          both deadly and debilitating. Vaccinations are not just for children;
          they are also crucial for adults. Did you know that the vaccines that
          we take as a kid often fade over the years as bacteria and virus
          mutate. Without regular vaccination, your lifestyle may make more
          suscetible to some diseases that can even lead to death.
